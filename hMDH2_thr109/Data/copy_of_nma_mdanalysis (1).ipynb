        "Welcome to the world of biomolecule dynamics! This lesson aims to teach you the basic protocol of simulating protein dynamics and analyzing the simulation. If you don't know how to code, don't worry! These lessons assume no prior knowledge of code or Python.\n",

        "## Analyzing molecular dynamics\n",
        "MD simulates the motion of molecules and can describe how the structure changes over time. The analysis of molecular dynamics extracts properties from the \"movie\" of the molecule such as how mobile areas of the molecule were and how the pKa values of certain functional groups can vary as the molecule moves. This information can help describe the mechanism of action as conformational changes in enzymes are linked to catalytic activity and pKa is related to nucleophilicty.\n",
        "\n",
        "The specific protocol for simulating dynamics in this notebook is elastic networks modeling. In this approach, the amino acids are simiplified a bit and connected by virtual springs. This allows for simulation of the structure around the starting state to show **potential** dynamic areas within the molecule. While not as comprehensive as all-atom simulations of biomolecules which include often solvent and atoms charges, this approach is a good first step in understanding how the molecule moves. In addition, this approach can provide insights into how how drastic changes in protein sequence are to the dynamics of the protein. As with all computational approaches, these models and simulations should be supported with experimental data as feasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What will I get from this Colab?\n",
        "The first section of the Colab sets up the Python environment and runs the simulation of motion. The second section of the Colab describes which areas of the molecule are most dynamic. Finally, the code will calculate the pKa values for each frame of the simulation to show pKa values over time. These values and outputs can be compared to simulations of mutants or the protein with ligands to determine how these changes to the simulation environment alter the dynamics of the molecule.\n",
